            <p><strong>Studyportals</strong> began as a spin-off from a couple of large international study associations. It was born out of frustration, a total lack of information and overview of the fast-growing number of international Masterâ€™s programmes in Europe. In 2007, <span className="text-link">Mastersportal.com</span> was developed and proved to be a roaring success. Soon after, <span className="text-link">Bachelorsportal.com</span>, <span className="text-link">PhDportal.com</span>, <span className="text-link">Shortcoursesportal.com</span>, and <span className="text-link">Distancelearningportal.com</span> followed.</p>
            <br/>

            <p>In 2021, we helped 52 million students around the world to explore study programmes and make an informed choice, throughout over 200,000 courses at 3,750+ educational institutes across 110 countries.</p>
